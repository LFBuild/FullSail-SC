# üõ°Ô∏è **Oracle Compromise Protection System in FullSail Protocol**

## üéØ **General Operating Principle**

In our protocol, there is a method `sync_o_sail_distribution_price` that is called every 10-15 minutes to update token prices. It is in this method that we will conduct all security checks before updating the price.

**Important**: The entire protection system will be implemented as a **separate module** `price_monitor`, which will be integrated with existing code but will not change the main protocol logic.

---

## üîç **1. Multi-Oracle Validation (Oracle vs Pool Comparison)**

### **What We Check**
We compare the price from an external oracle (Switchboard) with the current price from our pool.

### **How It Works**
```
1. Get price from Switchboard: "ETH costs $3000"
2. Get price from our pool: "ETH costs $2800"  
3. Calculate deviation: (3000-2800)/2800 = 7.1%
4. Check: 7.1% < 25% ‚úÖ (normal)
```

### **Activation Thresholds**
- **Up to 25%**: Everything is fine, update the price
- **25-50%**: Warning, but update
- **50-75%**: Critical, block update
- **More than 75%**: Emergency situation, pause protocol emissions

### **Why This Is Needed**
If someone hacks Switchboard and substitutes a fake price, we will notice it immediately by comparing it with the real price in our pool.

---

## üìä **2. Statistical Anomaly Detection (Price History Analysis)**

### **What We Check**
We analyze how much the new price differs from historical data over the last 50-70 updates.

### **How It Works**
```
ETH price history over last 50 updates:
$2800, $2810, $2795, $2805, $2790, $2800, $2795, $2805, $2790, $2800...

Average price: $2800
Standard deviation: $7.5

New price: $5000
Z-Score: (5000-2800)/7.5 = 293.3 ‚ùå (extremely high!)
```

### **Activation Thresholds**
- **Z-Score up to 2.5**: Normal
- **Z-Score 2.5-3.0**: Suspicious
- **Z-Score 3.0-4.0**: Critical
- **Z-Score more than 4.0**: Emergency

### **Why This Is Needed**
Even if the oracle is not hacked, but a technical failure occurs and the price "jumps" to unrealistic values, we will identify it through statistical analysis.

## üö® **3. Circuit Breaker System (Automatic Protection)**

### **What It Does**
Automatically makes decisions and performs actions to protect the protocol based on check results.

### **How It Works**
```
Check Results:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multi-Oracle: 78% deviation ‚ùå (critical)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Statistical: Z-Score 293.3 ‚ùå (emergency)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Circuit Breaker makes decision:

Level 1 (Warning): Log the problem
Level 2 (Critical): Block price update  
Level 3 (Emergency): Pause protocol emissions
```

### **Protection Levels**
- **Warning**: Only logging and notifications
- **Critical**: Block critical operations
- **Emergency**: Complete protocol emissions pause

### **Why This Is Needed**
Instead of waiting for the team to notice the problem and react manually, the system automatically protects the protocol within seconds.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Separate price_monitor Module**
The entire protection system will be implemented as a **separate module** `distribution::price_monitor`, which:

- **Does not change** existing protocol code
- **Integrates** with the `sync_o_sail_distribution_price` method
- **Provides** API for price validation
- **Returns** analysis results and action recommendations

### **Integration with Existing Code**
```
price_monitor module:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contains all validation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Provides API functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Returns security status
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Integrates with emergency council

sync_o_sail_distribution_price method:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calls validations from price_monitor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives analysis results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makes decision based on results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Performs protective actions if necessary
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How Everything Works Together in sync_o_sail_distribution_price**

### **Validation Sequence**
```
1. Call sync_o_sail_distribution_price every 10-15 minutes

2. Multi-Oracle Validation:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Get price from Switchboard
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Get price from pool
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Compare and calculate deviation

3. Statistical Anomaly Detection:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analyze price history
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calculate Z-Score for new price
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Determine anomaly level

4. Circuit Breaker System:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives results from both checks
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makes decision about actions
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Performs protective measures

5. If all checks pass:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Update price in protocol
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Continue normal operation
```

### **Real Scenario Example**
```
Hacker hacks Switchboard and substitutes ETH price from $2800 to $5000

1. sync_o_sail_distribution_price is called at 15:30

2. Multi-Oracle Validation:
   - Switchboard: $5000
   - Pool: $2800
   - Deviation: 78.6% ‚ùå (critical!)

3. Statistical Anomaly Detection:
   - History: $2800 ¬± $10
   - New price: $5000  
   - Z-Score: 293.3 ‚ùå (emergency!)

4. Circuit Breaker System:
   - Receives: "Critical!" + "Emergency!"
   - Decision: Activate Emergency level
   - Action: Pause protocol emissions

5. Result:
   - Protocol protected in seconds
   - Users cannot be harmed
   - Team notified about the problem
```
