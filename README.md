Audit scope:

- `distribution/sources/*.move`
- `liquidity_locker/sources/liquidity_lock_v2.move`

## Overview

A Dex Smart Contract implementing ve(4,4) model which is a modification of ve(3,3) model. On SUI.

## Integration

Packages that are supposed to be used for integration:

- `governance` - the main package implementing position staking and voting.
- `voting_escrow` - package implementing veSAIL locks.
- `integrate` - utilities to help integrate with smart contracts

Other packages are either irrelevant or deprecated.

Consider reading our [docs](https://docs.fullsail.finance/)

### Some key features

- all of the positions must be staked in [Gauges](governance/sources/gauge.move). Unstaked positions earn zero fees.
- When a position is Staked the underlying `Position` is wrapped into `gauge::StakedPosition` object.
- Staked positions earn oSAIL tokens instead of fees.
- Staked positions still earn rewards from Rewarder.
- Each oSAIL token type has an expiration date. If oSAIL is not expired you can either buy SAIL with 50% discount using it or lock it for 6 mounths, 2 years or 4 years. If oSAIL is expired you can only lock it for 4 years and receive veSAIL in return. After a veSAIL lock ends you receive a liquid SAIL.
- There is a new oSAIL type every week. oSAIL type of the claimed rewards is determined by the week you are claiming a position rewards in.

### Position methods

- `gauge::deposit_position` - stakes the position. You need to claim all of the position fees prior to staking.
- `gauge::withdraw_position` - unstakes the position. You need to claim all of the oSAIL tokens prior to unstaking.
- `minter::get_position_reward` - claims oSAIL for the position. oSAIL needs to be claimed from oldest one to the newest one. You can't claim the oSAIL of the epoch 2 unless you claimed oSAIL of the epoch 1.
- `minter::get_pool_reward` - claims Rewarder rewards. These rewards are deposited into pools externally and are distributed with constant speed.

You could also use some utility methods from [integrate package](integrate/sources/staked_position_script.move). These methods just combine listed above or provide more convenient signatures.

## Installation Instructions

- Install SUI. You can reference this link: https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install
- Need to have SUI Wallet Extension or App for interacting with SUI chain by GUI
